Today, blockchain solutions are Web 2.5; where a small portion of the application is serviced by a trusted RPC to a blockchain; typically for transaction settlement. The rest of the application conforms to web2 standards and is hosted and served using private, off-chain compute.&#x20;

#### _At Concordance Labs, we think we can do better._&#x20;

#### We built the Convoy, a 3-part unified system to create, launch, and serve fully on-chain applications.&#x20;

* A [framework](../technical-guides/framework-wayfinder.md) to structure applications
* A [platform](../technical-guides/platform-outrider.md) to launch applications
* An [execution client](../technical-guides/convoy-client.md) that serves your server-side requests fully on-chain

Together, our tools create a new category of on-chain applications.&#x20;

#### Our goals

* Provide developers with a simple and clear approach for writing responsive applications with web3 capabilities
* Simplify data management for businesses, and increase data privacy for individuals&#x20;
* Create an alternative to cloud or on-prem server management&#x20;

#### Our Features&#x20;

* Extension of Blockchain features to your application
* Built-in on-chain sessions-handling, authorization, and authentication&#x20;
* End-to-end data privacy&#x20;
* Asynchronous data fetching&#x20;
* Infrastructure abstraction&#x20;
* Resilient application performance&#x20;
