Today, blockchain solutions are Web 2.5; where a small portion of the application is serviced by a trusted RPC to a blockchain; typically for transaction settlement. The rest of the application conforms to web2 standards and is hosted and served using private, off-chain compute.&#x20;

_At Concordance Labs, we think we can do better._&#x20;

#### Developer tools for workflow orchestration. Create, launch, and serve fully on-chain applications.&#x20;

This end-to-end solution enables a new class of on-chain applications.&#x20;

#### Our goals

* Provide developers with a simple and clear approach for writing feature-rich applications with web3 capabilities.
* Establish blockchain as a viable alternative to cloud or on-premise server management for coordination use cases.
* Streamline state management for applications, and increase data privacy for individuals.

#### Our Features

* Built-in on-chain sessions-handling, authorization, and authentication&#x20;
* End-to-end data privacy&#x20;
* Asynchronous background data fetching&#x20;
* Infrastructure abstraction&#x20;
* Resilient application performance&#x20;
*   Extension of Blockchain trustlessness, coordination, and security to your application
