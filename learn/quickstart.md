Today, blockchain solutions are Web 2.5; a small portion of the application is serviced by a trusted RPC to a blockchain; typically for transaction settlement. The rest of the application is hosted and served using off-chain compute and adopt web2 standards.&#x20;

#### _At Concordance Labs, we think we can do better._&#x20;

#### We built the Convoy, a 3-part system to create, launch, and serve fully on-chain applications.&#x20;
