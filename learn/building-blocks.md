# Building Blocks

## About&#x20;

Concordance is dedicated to unlocking the compute power of blockchain for all types of server-side application traffic. &#x20;

The Concordance Labs team is building a premier suite of tools; the Convoy; a unified system designed to flex the security, decentralization, and trustlessness of blockchain for any use case, while abstracting away the complexity infrastructure integration.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
At Concordance Labs, we look at blockchain from a system perspective. Want to reimagine the blockchain ecosystem? See our[ mental model for blockchain](a-new-mental-model-for-blockchain.md) section to learn more.

#### Our tools create a new category of blockchain-based applications&#x20;

A category where blockchain is embedded into the application, instead of a feature to the application.&#x20;

Developers focus on business logic, and Concordance performs the triage and distribution of tasks to be executed in the correct place.



The interface provided by Concordance allows developers to write business logic at the app layer.&#x20;

Developers define portions, or their entire application in terms of state, both globally, which is stored onchain as resources and resource logic, and locally, which with Concordance, is persisted securely for  each user session.&#x20;

Under the. hood, Concordance is an end-to-end data interface for web3 applications, providing developers a system for data modeling and data pipelining processes in blockchain-based applications. \
Concordanceâ€™s domain is the edge between off-chain compute and on-chain compute, providing a developer experience where these systems feel interconnected. \
