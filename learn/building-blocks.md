# Building Blocks

## About&#x20;

Concordance is dedicated to unlocking the compute power of blockchain for all types of server-side application traffic. &#x20;

The Concordance Labs team is building a premier suite of tools; the Convoy; a unified system designed to flex the security, decentralization, and trustlessness of blockchain for any use case, while abstracting away blockchain infrastructure.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
At Concordance Labs, we look at blockchain from a system perspective. Want to reimagine the blockchain ecosystem? See our[ mental model for blockchain](a-new-mental-model-for-blockchain.md) section to learn more.
{% endhint %}



#### Our tools create a new category of blockchain-based applications&#x20;

A category where blockchain is embedded into the application, instead of a feature to the application.&#x20;
