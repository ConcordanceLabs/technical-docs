# A different mental model for Blockchain

### Blockchains are State Machines

Some say that blockchains are databases (it's a generous description.)&#x20;

&#x20;Blockchains are not databases, rather they are the simplest type of compute; a deterministic state machine. For a blockchain, there are only a few components:

1. Global State (the Ledger)&#x20;
2. State Transitions (updates to the Ledger)&#x20;
3. Consensus&#x20;

These distributed systems work to ensure that everyone agrees on the current state of the system, and that any update to the state -a state transition - is valid. The assurance of state agreement happens through a cryptographically strong consensus and validation process.&#x20;

* to leverage the benefits of blockchain; security, trustlessness,&#x20;

Everyone in a blockchain ecosystem is focused on state.&#x20;

Even smart contracts, a revolutionary progression, is a means to enhance the conditions in which you update state. Meaning, state can be invoked through a button press,&#x20;

But for a Web3 application, you need more than state. That's where we come in.&#x20;
