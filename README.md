# Concordance Labs

## About&#x20;

Concordance Labs is a team dedicated to unlocking the compute power of blockchain for all types of server-side application traffic. &#x20;

## What&#x20;

The blockchain ecosystem can be grouped into two segments.&#x20;

### Segment 1: Blockchains are State Machines&#x20;

Blockchains are deterministic finite state automata, which know only their current state, an acceptable set of states, and the state transition function. A blockchain's entire state is contained as its ledger.

### Segment 2: Everything else is a Data Abstraction&#x20;

To expand blockchain capabilities (and enable DeFi, DeSci, GameFi), we employ intermediaries like bridges, oracles, and indexers. These trusted intermediaries manage data processes that a state machine cannot.&#x20;

For any action in web3 beyond state transition, users and builders must choose from the intermediaries available, accept the outlined constraints of their specialized process, adopt their tenants, and pay their toll.&#x20;

i.e. Bridges bring transaction data cross-chain. You must accept their version of synthetic, wrapped, or minted tokens, trust their security, and pay their fee.&#x20;

### Concordance Solves for Data Abstraction&#x20;

We propose Convoy; a new protocol for arbitrary data abstraction. &#x20;

This protocol removes intermediaries who facilitate processes of data abstraction, and allow for both objective and subjective data-dependent applications to run fully on-chain.&#x20;

## How

We abstract data as a system, for any arbitrary data processes. Users and builders are not bound to piecemeal process enablement.&#x20;

Our protocol optimizes data compression, and secure package transfer, and enables responsive I/O from the client.&#x20;

## Why

#### Blockchain should be a strong alternative to the cloud or on-premise server hosting.&#x20;

**Allow developers to focus on developing the best blockchain-based technology possible.** Developers should focus on enabling the solutions they want using blockchain instead of fighting with infrastructure, compromising on the features they can create, or making appchains, sidechains, or rollups that fragment liquidity and compromise strong security.

**Blockchain should be trustless.** Developers should not have to rely on intermediaries. &#x20;

**Give users transparency and control over their data.** Users should know what happens to their data when they provide it as required on the internet.
