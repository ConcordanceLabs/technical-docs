# Concordance Labs

About&#x20;

Concordance Labs is a team dedicated to unlocking the compute power of blockchain for all types of server-side application traffic.  \


What&#x20;

Anything that is not a state machine is a data abstraction.&#x20;

The state layer must know of the abstraction layer or else the users are forced to use intermediaries.&#x20;

Anoma is our state machine. We are the data abstraction layer.

The goal is to enable any data infrastructure needed to alter the state without acting as an intermediary.&#x20;



A framework designed to efficiently handle complex business and data logic to easily enable interactive features like search, add to cart, sessions, and more.&#x20;

Reliable, idempotent, performant routing.&#x20;

Seamlessly handle asynchronous client state.&#x20;



All in one Platform to configure, and deploy your application. Set your domain, and manage traffic.



The client design allows for variable input from predefined I/O as when defined in your business logic.&#x20;



How

we are creating a system that allows business logic to be integrated into the ecosystem and solved by the ecosystem.&#x20;



Why

Businesses do not have to manage data infrastructure both on chain and offchain.&#x20;

Busineses do not have to create appchains, sidechains, rollups which fragment liquidity and&#x20;

Users give less Users should know what happens to their data when they give on the internet.
