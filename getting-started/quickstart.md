# Overview

Today's blockchain solutions are Web 2.5; a small portion of the application is serviced by a trusted RPC to a blockchain; typically for transaction settlement.&#x20;

_At Concordance Labs, we think we can do better._&#x20;

So we are creating frameworks, tools, and platforms to allow developers to build applications where the blockchain serves requests, enabling trustless applications without the need for rent-seeking intermediaries, and unlocking a fully on-chain experience for users.&#x20;

### How it Works

Some say that blockchains are databases (it's a generous description.)&#x20;

&#x20;Blockchains are not databases, rather they are the simplest type of compute; a deterministic state machine. For a blockchain, there are only a few components:

1. Global State (the Ledger)&#x20;
2. State Transitions (updates to the Ledger)&#x20;
3. Consensus&#x20;

These distributed systems work to ensure that everyone agrees on the current state of the system, and that any update to the state -a state transition - is valid. The assurance of state agreement happens through a cryptographically strong consensus and validation process.&#x20;

Everyone in a blockchain ecosystem is focused on state.&#x20;

Even smart contracts, a revolutionary progression, is a means to enhance the conditions in which you update state. Meaning, state can be invoked through a button press,&#x20;

But for a Web3 application, you need more than state. That's where we come in.&#x20;







### Import



GitBook supports importing content from many popular writing tools and formats. If your content already exists, you can upload a file or group of files to be imported.

### Sync a repository

GitBook also allows you to set up a bi-directional sync with an existing repository on GitHub or GitLab. Setting up Git Sync allows you and your team to write content in GitBook or in code, and never have to worry about your content becoming out of sync.
